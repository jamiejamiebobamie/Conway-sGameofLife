     <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
     <blockquote>
     <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an ... orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead...</p>
     <p>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</p>
     <p>At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p>

<ol>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</ol>
<ol>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</ol>
<ol>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</ol>
<ol>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</ol>
<p>The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.</p></blockquote>
