     <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
     <p></p>
     <p>Conways's Game of Life is made up of square cells arranged in a grid. Each cell is either alive or dead</quote>.</p>
     <p>Whether a cell is dead or alive depends on the cell's neighbours (eight in all).</p>
     <p>Every turn, cells live, die or are "born" based on these rules:</p>
<ol>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</ol>
<ol>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</ol>
<ol>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</ol>
<ol>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</ol>
<p></p>
<p>In my Game of Life, when a new cell is "born" it inherits its color from the cells that gave to "birth" it.</p>
